      Receiving Aerial</h2>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;">by Neal Arundale - M1CHS</h3>
    <h4>Background</h4>
    Living by the sea and having an interest in both yachting and radio,
    I became interested in AIS as soon as the inexpensive Nasa AIS
    engine became available. I use the Nasa engine in conjunction with
    Seaclear software when sailing offshore on friends Yachts, and the
    SR162 with ShipPlotter at home. See <a href="sr162_nasa.html">Comparative












      performance of Nasa, SR162 and Comar AIS-2-usb</a> Over the last
    year, I have been experimenting with different aerials&nbsp;to try
    and improve my reception distance at home. See <a
      href="aerial_comparisons.html">AIS Aerial Performance Comparisons</a><br>
    I would be interested in any comments,&nbsp;

    <h4>Location</h4>
    My home is in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, UK about ½ mile from the
    sea and 250 feet above sea level facing the North Sea. I cannot
    actually see the sea from my home as the line of sight is obscured
    by houses, trees and the Castle headland. There are 400 feet cliffs
    10 miles north and south. My aerial is currently located on top of
    the flat roof of my garage, giving easy access to the aerial. At
    some time in the future, I will probably locate the aerial on the
    chimney stack but for the present it is more useful to be able to
    gain access to the aerial easily and enables me to make a
    comparative judgment as to the effectiveness of the ideas I have
    been trying. I am fortunate in having daily ferries passing 30 miles
    offshore, Hull 30 miles across land as well as a number of rigs
    (normally having the same support vessels) 30+ miles offshore,and
    two receivers which&nbsp;help to judge the aerials' performance.<br>

    <h4>Increasing Reception Range</h4>
    AIS signals are transmitted at VHF frequencies, which like
    terrestrial TV signals do not "bend" over the horizon. They are line
    of sight, typically 20 miles at reasonable aerial heights. &nbsp;AIS
    signals are very sensitive to any distortion, a bit like digital
    terrestrial TV - the picture is good, very scrambled,
    or&nbsp;nothing - there's no in between. Increasing the sensitivity
    of the receiver by, for example, adding &nbsp;a aerial pre-amplifier
    may make little or no difference to your ability to receive weak
    signals. This is because the receiver will amplify the signal, noise
    and distortion equally, so the information contained in the signal
    still cannot be decoded by the receiver or computer.The way round
    the problem is to improve the gain of the aerial and to reduce the
    noise introduced into the receiver by the downlead. The gain of the
    aerial is indicative of the amount by which the aerial will increase
    the signal relative to the background noise, and is why a good
    aerial is so important to the reception of weak signals. A shorter
    downlead or using better quality cable will introduce less noise
    into the receiver.<br>
    I have tried to give some idea of the range of the various aerials I
    have tried and should be taken more as an indication of the relative
    performance of one aerial compared with another. The actual
    performance will depend on the aerials location and height, and, at
    over the horizon distance, <a
      href="http://www.mike-willis.com/Tutorial/PF6.htm">propagation
      conditions</a> are important, but can on occasions result in
    reliable signals being received from over 100 miles away.<br>
    Click <a href="horizon.html">here</a> for a chart of horizon
    distance against aerial height.
    <h4>Collinear Aerials</h4>
    Aerials do not actually produce gain, they are more sensitive in a
    given direction. It's like putting a lens in front of the light in a
    light house, the light is concentrated in one direction, so at sea
    level the light is bright (where you want it) and 20° above the
    light will be much dimmer. Comparing with an aerial, the gain is the
    amount the light is brighter, looking at the light in the direction
    of the lens, than the light would be with no lens. A vertical
    collinear aerial is equally sensitive 360° around the aerial in the
    horizontal plane, but as the number of elements are increased,
    the&nbsp;increasing sensitivity in the horizontal plane is matched
    by a decrease in the sensitivity above and below the horizontal. By
    using 50ohm coax for the active elements, there is no impedance
    matching problem.
    <h4>Mk1 plain wire</h4>
    My first aerial was a plain wire attached to the end of the centre
    conductor of a length of RG58 coax, hung from the inside of my
    lounge window. This enabled me to receive AIS on the Nasa engine but
    only up to a range of around 5 miles. The length of the wire aerial
    proved to be very critical, the optimum appearing to be around 80
    cms, this increased the range to around 10 miles.
    <h4>Silva Marine VHF aerial</h4>
    The results from this were to say the least disappointing, although
    better than a plain wire, it was not much better, even though it was
    mounted on my garage roof.
    <h4>Amateur 2m aerial</h4>
    This was a <a
      href="http://www.diamond-ant.co.jp/english/index.html"> Diamond
      F-22 collinear</a> 144Mhz &nbsp;(amateur 2m band). At 3.2 meters
    long was quite a large aerial. The aerial is tuned to 144Mhz whereas
    AIS is 162Mhz, thus it was some 10% off its centre frequency .It was
    a big improvement over the marine VHF aerial, more than doubling the
    minimum range to around 20-25 miles.
    <h4>Mk1 - &nbsp;5 element Collinear</h4>
    After researching the Internet (see references/links below), my
    first home constructed collinear was a great success, with a range
    of 25-30 miles. It was very simple to construct being basically a 3
    meter length of wire which I hung from the gutter of the roof above
    the flat roof of the garage.<br>

    The above dimensions are immediately prior to soldering and show how
    the ends solder together. Click the thumbnail to enlarge.<br>
    RG213 coax was used for the feed as I already had a wire in place.
    If you do not have any RG213, I would try using RG58, particularly
    if the cable run is quite small. Do not use RG213 for the aerial.
    Both coaxes are 50 ohm for matching purposes. 75 ohm TV or satellite
    coax theoretically should not work well, but I haven't actually
    tried it (if anyone wants to try you'll have to adjust the lengths
    by the velocity factor of the cable you use). <br>
    <br>
    Practice a joint or two first to ensure you get the length correct
    after soldering<br>

    I constructed the aerial in an hour or so, total cost about £2. I
    also managed to hang it from the gutter using a long pole<br>
    <h5>Modification tried</h5>
    Replacing the top ¼ wave top rod with ¼ wave shorted coax and ¼ wave
    top rod. &nbsp;The reception distance was halved. Many&nbsp;marine
    VHF aerials would appear to be constructed in a similar way as they
    are designed to work with transmitters. They are often called DC
    grounded as a resistance check will indicated a short between the
    screen and the aerial.<br>

    <h4>Mk2 - 9 element vertical collinear with ground plane</h4>
    Self supporting 6 meters high, range 35-45 miles.<br>
    Can be constructed without the ground plane with reduced range<br>
    Unobtrusive to neighbours<br>
    The aerial fits cleanly inside the <a
      href="http://www.sotabeams.co.uk/sota-poles/">Sota</a> 7 meter
    fibreglass pole. This is tapered along its length and comes in seven
    telescopic sections (like a transistor radio aerial).<br>
    <ol>
      <li>Construct 8 sections of RG58 coax&nbsp;the same manner as in
        the Mk 1 aerial above up to step 7</li>
      <li>Slip a 2" (5 cm) sleeve over the coax &nbsp;RG58 cover to
        strengthen the eventual joint. I used a length of sleeving
        removed from standard TV aerial coax. This was a fairly tight
        fit, but slipped on nicely when lubricated with a touch of
        washing up liquid</li>
      <li>Continue with steps 8 to 10</li>
      <li>When all 8 sections are soldered together check the continuity</li>
      <li>Slip the sleeves over the joints</li>
      <li>Again check the continuity</li>
      <li>Hang the coax up and seal the sleeves onto the RG58 coax cover
        with araldite at each end of the sleeve<br>
        <img style="height: 20%;" alt="Joint" src="joint.jpg"> </li>
      <li>Leave the araldite overnight to dry</li>
      <li>When dry, again check the continuity. Mine was OK so I didn't
        have to locate and fix a bad joint. I suspect if&nbsp; your
        soldering is not up to scratch&nbsp;you'll probably have to
        start again.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Cut a length of about 1½ metres of RG213 coax</li>
      <li>Cut about 25mm of sleeve off one end the RG213 coax</li>
      <li>Unbraid the braid on the coax back to the sleeve. The coax
        tail will be required if you fit the ground plane<br>
        <img style="height: 20%;" alt="rg213end" src="rg213end.gif"></li>
      <li>Obtain a 16M plastic cable gland from an electrical
        wholesaler. It must be able to clamp the RG58 cable <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">and</span> allow the RG213 to enter
        through the threaded side <span style="font-weight: bold;">and</span>
        you must be able to tighten the nut from within the cup of the
        cap. I had to file the nut down a fraction. <br>
        <img style="height: 20%;" alt="plasticgland"
          src="plasticgland.jpg"><br>
      </li>
      <li>File a slot in the threaded (bolt) part of the cable gland
        just sufficient to slot the unbraided coax into when the RG213
        coax is pushed through the bolt end of the gland towards the nut
        end. I used a Dremel. <br>
        <img style="height: 20%;" alt="glandslot" src="glandslot.gif"> </li>
      <li>Put all the cable gland except the nut onto the RG58 coax
        before joining the RG58 &amp; RG213 coaxes</li>
      <li>Obtain a copper or brass washer that will just fit over the
        cable gland bolt<br>
        <img style="height: 20%;" alt="washer" src="washer.gif"></li>
      <li>Make a cup to hold the ground plane
        <ol>
          <li>Cut a 46.3 cm (¼ wave) length of 28 mm copper tube for the
            ground plane</li>
          <li>Obtain a plain (not "Yorkshire") 28mm copper joint sleeve,
            file off the centre groove so that the sleeve will slide
            right over the tube, and is a quite tight fit</li>
          <li>Cut a further 1 cm ring of the same tube</li>
          <li>Saw through the ring to split it open</li>
          <li>By filing the saw cut open and squeezing it together,
            create an insert that just fits into to copper tube<br>
            <img style="height: 20%;" alt="insert" src="insert.gif"></li>
          <li>&nbsp;Push the insert half way into the tube to hold it
            together and solder a 28mm copper or brass washer onto the
            top of the insert. The washer will eventually hold the 16m
            cable gland, so check you can fit the gland before you
            solder it. You may need to enlarge the centre of the washer
            after soldering.<br>

              src="insertcap.gif"><br>
            When completed the cap should be a tight fit in the copper
            tube</li>

      <li>This is how they assemble together<br>
        <img style="height: 20%;" alt="jointbits" src="jointbits.gif"><br>
      </li>
      <li>Push the RG213 right into the cable gland (leaving the braid
        tail through the slot), while allowing the nut and clamping
        washer to tighten firmly on the RG58 coax. When satisfied, clamp
        the cable gland firmly onto the RG58 coax by tightening the nut<br>
        <img style="height: 20%;" alt="explodedjoint"
          src="explodedjoint.gif"><br>
      </li>
      <li>Push the copper/brass washer tightly down over the gland bolt
        so that the plastic nut will tighten onto the washer and braid</li>
      <li>Put the plastic nut on and tighten up. The whole joint should
        finish being mechanically &amp; electrically sound, as well as
        being waterproof from the top<br>
        <img style="height: 20%;" alt="assembledjoint"
          src="assembledjoint.gif"><br>
      </li>
      <li>Solder the top rod on to the end of the RG85<br>
        <img style="height: 20%;" alt="topjoint" src="topjoint.gif"><br>
      </li>
      <li>Put a 10mm offcut of RG58 sleeve over the top joint &amp; fill
        with araldite to strengthen the joint onto the cable</li>
      <li>Assemble the top and second section of the fibreglass pole.
        Mark &nbsp;the overlap on the pole so that when the pole is
        assembled you can accurately position the aerial alongside and
        outside the pole in order to determine where the bottom joint of
        the aerial will be in the pole</li>
      <li>Assemble the rest of the <a
          href="http://www.sotabeams.co.uk/sota-poles/">Sota</a> pole,
        position the aerial alongside and mark the outside of the pole
        exactly where the copper/brass cup washer will be located when
        inserted into the pole</li>
      <li>Position the sleeve on the outside of the tube (see section
        17.2) to act as a stop preventing the copper tube going
        further&nbsp;up the pole &amp; kinking the aerial coax<br>
        <img style="height: 20%;" alt="Copper Sleeve"
          src="copper_sleeve.jpg"></li>
      <li>Put the copper tube over the RG213 and push into the
        copper/brass cup</li>
      <li>Assemble the bottom two sections of the pole and mark on the
        outside of the bottom section where the next section ends</li>
      <li>Assemble the whole of the pole and lay the aerial alongside
        with the top of the aerial exactly where it will be when
        inserted in the pole</li>
      <li>Move the sleeve on the outside of the copper tube to the
        position where it will act as a stop when inserted into the
        pole. This prevents the aerial being kinked inside the pole.</li>
      <li>Cut the RG213 so that when a connector is added the whole of
        the connection will be within the bottom section of the pole</li>
      <li>Put on the N type jack<br>
        <img style="height: 20%;" alt="ntypejack" src="ntypejack.jpg"><br>
      </li>
      <li>Obtain a length of 25mm plastic electrical conduit, this will
        just slide into the copper tube. This must be prevented from
        going inside the copper tube as it is used to support the weight
        of the copper tube. I obtained a conduit joining sleeve which
        just slipped a couple of mm into the copper tube, and would slip
        over the conduit. Note the RG213 socket must go pass through the
        centre of this connector. Alternatively you could glue a washer
        or sleeve onto the plastic conduit, as long as the socket will
        pass through and it will fit inside the pole.<br>
        <img style="height: 20%;" alt="Conduit Sleeve"
          src="conduit_sleeve.jpg"> </li>
      <li>Before you assemble the aerial into the fibre glass pole,
        obtain 30 cm of&nbsp; 38 mm aluminum tube (TV aerial mounting
        pole). This should slide about ½ way down the outside of the
        bottom section of the pole. With a hack saw, make a longitudinal
        cut through one side only of the tube, from top to bottom.</li>
      <li>Slide the tube over the bottom section of the pole to nearly
        the bottom, prising the tube slightly open as required.
        &nbsp;This is where the pole will be clamped in the aerial
        mounting bracket. Note that as you tighten the mounting bracket
        clamps this tube will fit the taper of the fibreglass pole
        exactly<br>
        <img style="height: 20%;" alt="Split Tube" src="split.jpg"> </li>
      <li>Push the rubber centre bung out from the screw cap on the end
        of the bottom section of the pole and replace it with a plastic
        washer that just fits in the cap but will allow a N type plus
        through the centre. The hole must not allow a 25 mm plastic
        electric conduit pipe through. I manufactured the washer from an
        old plastic bottle. It must support the weight of the copper
        tube and RG213 cable.</li>
      <li>Cut the conduit at the&nbsp;correct length to just support the
        copper tube to the mark on the pole, whilst the conduit itself
        is supported be the end cap of the pole when it is screwed on
        the bottom of the pole. <br>

            The mechanics of the construction is how I made the aerial,
            there are probably better and/or simpler ways of building
            the aerial. Some of the references below may give you other
            ideas. Note however the electrical dimensions must be
            adhered to. PVC pipe (in place of fibreglass) may alter the
            electrical dimensions<small><span style="font-style:
                italic;"></span></small>, as it could affect the
            velocity factor of the aerial. Glass fibre is OK, carbon
            fibre is not. <small><span style="font-style: italic;">18/11/08











                a test with an antenna analyser indicated, when inserted
                in either a PVC or fibreglass tube, the resonant
                frequency was reduced by 2%. This is barely significant</span></small>.
            <br>
            I was also conscious of rain dripping into the joints as it
            would run down the pole, and if inside the pole, down the
            coax cable as well. This is why the bottom of the pole was
            not sealed, as it would help any moisture or condensation
            within the pole to dissipate.<br>
            The aerial has been subject to a 60 mph gale with no
            problems.<br>
            The ground plane appears to increase the range by about 20%,
            and also appears to reduce ships being "lost" under the high
            (400 feet) cliffs around Flamborough Head.<br>

    <h5>Futher modification (January 08)<br>
    </h5>
    <div><font size="2" face="Arial">I wasn't totally happy with the way
        the aerial wire hung down the <a
          href="http://www.sotabeams.co.uk/sota-poles/">Sota</a> pole as
        it tended to kink and really needed suspending from the top
        while still supporting the weight of the copper tube from the
        bottom.</font></div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div><font size="2" face="Arial">I replaced the top 1/2 inch of the
        top copper rod with a small (probably 8ba) screwed rod (again
        1/2 inch), made from a brass bolt with the head chopped off, by
        soldering the screwed section to the top of the copper rod. It
        must be small enough to protrude through the fibreglass pole
        (see below).</font></div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div><font size="2" face="Arial">I cut down the top section of the
        Sota pole so that the top 1/4 inch of the screwed rod just
        projected through the fibreglass at the top of the pole when the
        whole aerial was re-assembled.</font></div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div><font size="2" face="Arial">I found a small plastic cup that
        just (and only just) slipped over the top of the top section of
        the fibreglass. Something like the top of a biro would do only a
        bit smaller - I actually used a hypodermic needle cover !!</font></div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div><font size="2" face="Arial">I carefully araldited a couple of
        brass nuts into the plastic cup with a similar bolt in place
        (until the araldite was set) in such a way that I could use the
        cup to hold the top rod + the weight of the coax at the top of
        the pole.</font></div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div><font size="2" face="Arial">In this manner I could dissemble
        the aerial from the pole at a later date if required, adjust the
        length to just prevent the coax kinking, and&nbsp;maintain a
        waterproof cover over the top of the pole.<br>

    <h4>Equipment &amp; Software</h4>
    I use a <a
href="http://www.diytrade.com/china/4/manufacturers/96914/products-list.html">Smart












      Radio</a> SR162 &nbsp;dual channel receiver at home, purchased
    direct from Smart at $460 including air freight. Delivery took 5
    days. I also have a <a
      href="http://www.nasamarine.com/products.php?cat=18"> Nasa</a> AIS
    engine. This enables me to compare the relative performance of both
    the aerials and the receivers. The sensitivity and response of both
    receivers can be judged from the comparison&nbsp;<a
      href="sr162_nasa.html">here</a>. Notice the Smart monitors both
    AIS channels simultaneously, whereas the Nasa switches between the
    channels.<br>
    At home I use the ShipPlotter software because it makes it simple to
    download data to other servers. When sailing I use the Nasa engine
    with the SeaClear software because SeaClear has much better chart
    management and displays NMEA info alongside the chart.<br>
    The ShipPlotter software will accept decoded NMEA input as well as
    raw audio. Both receivers output decoded NMEA . I put a <a
      href="http://www.discriminator.nl/index-en.html">discriminator tap</a>
    on the IC inside the Nasa engine to see if the ShipPlotter program
    would make a better job of decoding the audio signal than the Nasa
    engine. It<font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="font-weight:
        bold;"></span></font> made no difference.<br>

      </span></font><font size="2" face="Arial"> I'm using a coaxial
      relay to switch the aerials under control of the same PC running
      Shipplotter and plotting the graphs. It is synchronised to plot
      message rate (1) or (2) on the graph as the aerial is switched.
      Every alternate message rate is therefore recorded for a different
      aerial. The two aerials are located at the same height about 10
      feet apart, using the same type and length of downlead and feeding
      the same AIS receiver.</font><br>
    <h4>Calculations</h4>
    v=f&#955; <br>
    where v=velocity, f=frequency and &#955;=wavelength<br>
    In our case we want wavelength so &#955;= v/f<br>
    V is the velocity of propagation which is the speed of light in free
    space<br>
    AIS frequencies are 161.975 MHz and 162.025 MHz<br>
    One wavelength &#955; in free space is 300/162 = 1.852 metres = 185.2 cm<br>
