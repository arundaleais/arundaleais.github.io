Note for Windows Vista users. (Thanks to Jeff Richards)<br>
=============================<br>
<br>
This note may also apply to Windows 7 users, depending on security
configuration.<br>
<br>
AIS Decoder must be run with administrator privileges enabled. If AIS
Decoder starts with the Options button disabled, then it is likely that
you are not running the program with administrator privileges.<br>
<br>
Running as administrator is required because AIS Decoder requires write
access to the installation folder. User Access Control (UAC) in Vista
prevents write access to the Program Files folder and all its
sub folders, as part of the process of protecting the computer against
malicious software. To run with write access to the Program Files
folder, the program must be run by a user who has administrator
privileges, and it must be run with those privileges enabled.<br>
<br>
Running AIS Decoder with administrator privileges enabled does not
compromise the security of the computer. It simply means that you need
to confirm that it is OK to run AIS Decoder each time it starts.<br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">A further note from Neal Arundale.</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Although AisDecoder does require
administrator privileges to install, it should not require them to run,
however, if the user does not have administrator privilege, I
intentionally disable the Options button. This is so that if AisDecoder
is run in a networked environment, the administrator can stop a user
altering the settings, although they can alter the display. Normally a
single user would run their PC with administrator privilege so it is
not an issue. However there could be a situation where an administrator
would like to give a non-privileged user the option to alter the
settings.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">This can be done by by the
administrator running a .REG script after installation. If you require
further details, please contact myself.&nbsp;</span> <br
 style="font-style: italic;">
</span></font><br>
To enable AIS decoder to run with administrator privileges enabled you
need to modify the start menu item. <br>
1. Click Start and All Programs, and select AIS Decoder from the list<br>
2. Right-click the AIS Decoder item and choose properties<br>
3. Click the Advanced button and tick the 'Run as administrator' check
box<br>
4. Click OK and then click Apply and OK in the Properties dialogue. You
will be asked to confirm these changes.<br>
<br>
You can create a desktop shortcut to AIS Decoder.<br>
1. Click Start and All Programs, and select AIS Decoder from the list<br>
2. Press and hold the right mouse button over the AIS Decoder menu
entry and drag the entry onto a blank part of the desktop<br>
3. Before releasing the right mouse button, press and hold the Control
key.
The message 'Copy to desktop' will appear. <br>
4. Release the right mouse button, then release the Control key<br>
5. You may get another dialogue with options. If so, select the 'Copy
to here' option.<br>
<br>
If you haven't already set the start menu shortcut to run with
administrator privileges enabled,
you can change the setting for the desktop icon.<br>
1. Right click on the desktop icon and choose Properties from the menu
that appears<br>
2. Select the Shortcut tab and click the Advanced button<br>
3. Tick the 'Run as administrator' check box<br>
4. Click OK and then click Apply and OK in the Properties dialogue.<br>
<br>
You can now click the menu item or the desktop icon to start
AIS-Decoder.
If you have enabled administrator privileges you will be asked to
confirm execution of the program: running as administrator has not
disabled UAC, it has simply provided the user with the necessary
permissions, but approval to use that permission is still required.<br>
<br>
<br>
Serial Port Numbers<br>
===================<br>
<br>
AIS Decoder supports serial port (COM) numbers from 1 to 16 <br>
<br>
Some versions of Windows allow for many more than 16 serial ports. When
you are using USB to serial port adapters, it is easy to have more than
16 serial port numbers used, either a result of using different
adapters, or simply because of repeated attempts to get the adapter
driver software properly installed. This frequently occurs while
installing Blue-tooth devices, which can allocate a new serial port
number each time they connect.<br>
<br>
To change the serial port number used by a particular adapter, follow
the steps below.<br>
<br>
Vista
<br>
-----<br>
1. Click the Start men and select Control Panel. <br>
2. Select System and Maintenance (or just System in classic view) and
Device Manager<br>
3. Expand the 'Ports (COM and LPT)' item. Note which serial port (COM)
numbers are unused<br>
4. Double-click the port where you want to change the number. A
Properties dialogue will open<br>
5. Choose the Port Settings tab, and then select Advanced. An Advanced
Settings dialogue will open<br>
6. Select the new serial port number from the list in the drop-down at
the bottom of the dialogue.<br>
<br>
Note: You may get a warning that this port number is already in use
when you close the dialogue. This can happen even if the device is not
listed in Device manager. This is because the number is 'allocated' to
a device that is not currently connected (probably a USB to serial
converter). If you really need to use this port number for this device,
you can accept the warning and confirm the change to override the
existing allocation.<br>
<br>
7. Click OK and OK to close the dialogues.<br>
<br>
You can choose Action / Scan for Hardware Changes to have the new port
assignment displayed in Device Manager.<br>
<br>
Windows 7<br>
---------<br>
1. Click the Start men and select Control Panel. <br>
2. Select 'Hardware and Sound' and 'Device Manager' (under 'Devices and
Printers')<br>
3. Expand the 'Ports (COM and LPT)' item<br>
4. Double-click the port where you want to change the number. A
Properties dialogue will open<br>
5. Choose the Port Settings tab, and then select Advanced. An Advanced
Settings dialogue will open<br>
6. Drop down the list at the bottom of the dialogue. The ports are
listed, and the port numbers already in use are indicated<br>
7. Select the new serial port number from the list.<br>
<br>
Note: If you select a port that is marked as 'in use', You will get a
warning that this port number is already in use when you click OK in
the dialogue. This is because the number is 'allocated' to a device
that is not currently connected (probably a USB to serial converter).
If you really need to use this port number for this device, you can
accept the warning and confirm the change to override the existing
allocation.<br>
<br>
8. Click OK and OK to close the dialogues.<br>
<br>
You can choose Action / Scan for Hardware Changes to have the new port
assignment displayed in Device Manager.
