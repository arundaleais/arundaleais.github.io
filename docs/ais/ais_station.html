      style="font-family: Arial;"><br>
      I've tried to keep as much of the following a simple as possible
      while still including some meat for those who wish to know more
      about what's actually going on, or are having problems. Just stop
      when you've read enough to do what you want - or you're fed up
      -&nbsp; as it gradually gets more complicated.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
    </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: bold;">Introduction</span><br
      style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: bold;">
    <span style="font-family: Arial;">AIS (Automatic Identification
      System) is used by ships to report their position, speed course
      and other information to other ships and shore stations, by
      transmitting the relevant information at regular intervals, using
      a VHF radio link. It is used by ships to assist in collision
      avoidance and other safety related issues.</span><span
      style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: bold;"><br>
      <br>
      AIS Basics<br>
    </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Although primarily intended
      for inter-ship and ship-to-shore communications, the signals
      transmitted can be picked up by any suitably equipped receiving
      station, enabling ships' positions to be displayed on a map or
      chart. The reception range is limited to VHF radio range, which is
      typically 10 to 40 miles.<br>
      <br style="font-family: Arial;">
    </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: bold;">Setting
      up a basic station</span><br style="font-family: Arial;
      font-weight: bold;">
    <span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: bold;"></span><span
      style="font-family: Arial;">It is not difficult to set up a simple
      home receiving station. You need an aerial connected to a
      receiver, connected to a display. Getting the whole to work is a
      bit like a jig-saw puzzle, each piece has to link properly to each
      other piece in the chain. If one doesn't, you may have to put
      another piece in between to link the two together that otherwise
      wouldn't fit.<br>

      <div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Arial;
          font-weight: bold;">VHF Signal<br>
        </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">The AIS signal is
          transmitted at VHF (Very High Frequency), broadly speaking
          this is similar to the frequency TV and FM radio is
          transmitted. As with TV, reception is limited to "line of
          sight", in other words the receiving aerial must be able to
          "see" the transmitting aerial. In fact reception distance is
          likely to be sightly greater than this, because radio waves
          bend a little round the Earth's surface.<br>
          Like TV reception a good aerial makes a significant difference
          to the reception, and height really does matter (otherwise you
          would not put TV aerials on chimney pots).</span><span

            style="font-weight: bold;">Types</small><br>
          A Marine VHF aerial will give reasonable reception, for about
          double the price of the cheapest marine aerial the <a
            href="http://www.saltyjohn.co.uk/metzmantavhfantennaaerial.htm">Metz





            Manta</a> will take some beating. It's still considerably
          less than the more expensive marine aerials.<br>
          If your handy with a soldering Iron you can make a ribbon
          cable "<a href="./slimjim.jpg">Slim-Jim</a>" for a few pence.

    <span style="font-family: Arial;">As already mentioned, the higher
      the better</span><br>
    <span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: bold;"><br>
      Downlead</span><br>
    <span style="font-family: Arial;"></span><span style="font-family:
      Arial;">Commercial aerials may come with a downlead already
      connected, or may come with just a socket at the base of the
      aerial. If supplied with a lead it will probably have a&nbsp;
      PL259 plug on the end of the downlead and your receiver will
      probably have a BNC connector for the aerial, in which case you
      will need an adapter. &nbsp; </span><span style="font-family:
      Arial; font-weight: bold;"><br>

    <br>
    <span style="font-family: Arial;">These are available from </span><a
      style="font-family: Arial;" href="http://www.maplin.co.uk/">Maplin</a><span

      style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: bold;"><br>
    </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">If no downlead is supplied
      you will need RF coax, which should be 50 ohm. To start with RG58
      is OK, RG213 is much better (particularly for longer runs)
      although considerably more expensive. TV or satellite coax cable
      is not suitable.<br>
      &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: bold;"></span><br
      style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: bold;">
    <span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: bold;">Receiver</span><br
      style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: bold;">
    <span style="font-family: Arial;">There are two basic options<br>
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
          Dedicated AIS receiver</span></small><br>
      This converts the VHF radio signal into a decoded digital signal
      suitable for direct connection to a PC or Chart Plotter. It is a
      "Black Box", There are no controls of any description, just an
      aerial socket, output socket and power supply (unless powered
      direct from a computer USB connection). The most popular are
      possibly&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nasamarine.com/">NASA</a> AIS
      engine,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.comarsystems.com/">Comar</a>
      and&nbsp;<a href="http://smartradio.diytrade.com/">SR161/162</a> .<br>
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
          Communications/Scanner Receiver</span></small><br>
      You can also use a Communications Receiver or Scanner. This
      outputs audio and requires an audio decoding program running on a
      PC.&nbsp; This is really only a practical proposition if you
      already have a suitable receiver or wish to use the receiver for
      other purposes. Not all scanners or receivers are suitable as they
      need to be able to receive the right frequency and importantly
      need a wide enough bandwidth. For more information on suitable
      receivers and possibly modifying an existing receiver see <a
        href="http://www.discriminator.nl/ais/index-en.html">http://www.discriminator.nl</a><br>
    </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: bold;"><br>
      Receiver to PC connection<br>
      <br>
    </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: bold;"></span><span
      style="font-family: Arial;">The output socket from a dedicated AIS
      receiver will be RS232 (serial) or USB or RJ45 (network). The
      output from a communications/scanner it will be a Jack (audio).
      The receiver must be connected to the same type of socket on the
      PC. The appropriate lead will probably be supplied with the
      receiver. If the receiver has a RS232 serial output, you can use a
      RS232-USB adapter lead containing both software and hardware
      within the socket to convert the signals. It costs around £20 from
    </span><a style="font-family: Arial;"
      href="http://www.maplin.co.uk/">Maplin</a><span
      style="font-family: Arial;"></span><span style="font-family:
      Arial;">. As the electrical signal in each type of lead are
      different, you cannot buy a simple adapter plug to change between
      each type of plug and socket. <br>
    </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: bold;"><img
        style="width: 500px; height: 100px;" alt=""
        src="./receiver_pc_plugs.jpg"><br>
    </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">As already mentioned, a
      communications receiver passes an audio signal to the PC, the
      other three types of connection all transport identical data from
      the receiver to the PC. Each of these three types (RS232,USB,RJ45)
      uses a different method to transport the data, even though the
      data is identical in each case. Its a bit like receiving the same
      letter in the post, by hand and by fax; in each case you receive
      the same letter but the method of transport is different. The
      format of this data is called NMEA (like the envelope containing
      the letter) . The decoded AIS signal is encapsulated within the
      NMEA format.<br>
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
    </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: bold;">PC
      Programs</span><br>
    <span style="font-family: Arial;">A PC or possibly a chart plotter,
      is used to display the AIS data in a visual manner, normally on a
      chart or a map.<br>
      There are a number of programs available, some are free, some
      shareware and some commercial. Because of copyright and chart
      format issues, simple maps/charts can be free or can be very
      expensive and not all charts are compatible with all programs.<br>
      To further complicate the choice, there are programs available to
      scan charts and stitch adjacent charts together. There are also
      programs which will overlay AIS data on Google maps.<br>
      Another complication is most programs and some computers do not
      accept serial,usb and network connections.<br>
      Because of the number of options, and after you have received and
      seen your first data, your preferences may change, it is quite
      probable your first program may not be the program you ultimately
      prefer. I would suggest initially using a simple free program, get
      used to the type of information you wish to see and how you prefer
      to see it displayed, before committing significant time and
      possibly money in software.<br>
      <a style="font-weight: bold;"
        href="http://www.coaa.co.uk/shipplotter.htm">ShipPlotter</a> is
      free to display your own data. It accepts serial and network
      connections. To accept USB you will need a <a
        href="http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm">virtual com port
        driver</a> which will allow you to use the software with a
      receiver using USB output. This driver is supplied with the </span><a
      style="font-family: Arial;" href="http://www.comarsystems.com/">Comar</a><span
      style="font-family: Arial;"> AIS-2-USB.<br>
      <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.seaclear.net/">SeaClear</a>
      is also free and is supplied with the </span><span
      style="font-family: Arial;"><a href="http://www.nasamarine.com/">NASA</a>
      AIS engine</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">. It only
      accepts serial input.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br>
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small></span><span
      style="font-family: Arial;"><br>
      In my view ShipPlotter is better for home use and </span><span
      style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><span style="font-family:
      Arial;">SeaClear more suitable for use on a boat. SeaClear is more
      complex to set up if you are not using serial input</span>.<br>
    <br style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: bold;">
    <span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: bold;">Connection
      Direct to the Internet<br>
    </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">You can run an AIS
      receiving station without using your own PC to process and display
      the received data. There are a number of websites who will display
      your data (as well as many others) for all to see. <a
        href="http://www.marinetraffic.com/ais/">Marine Traffic</a>, <a
        href="http://ais3.siitech.com/vtslite/AView.aspx">SIITech</a>
      and <a href="http://www.shipais.com/">ShipAIS</a> (UK only) all
      provide this free service. To send the data directly to the
      internet, the easiest way is to use a receiver with a network
      output such as the <a
        href="http://www.comarsystems.com/slr_200n_and_200ng.html">Comar
        SLR200N</a>, which you connect straight to your internet router
      using a RJ45 patch lead. If your receiver has a serial output you
      will need a serial to network converter such as the <a
        href="http://www.digi.com/products/serialservers/digionesp.jsp#overview">Didi





        One SP</a>, which is inserted between your receiver and your
      router.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
    </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: bold;">Using on
      a boat</span><br style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: bold;">
    <span style="font-family: Arial;">There are some additional
      considerations when using AIS on a boat. You will be considering
      using AIS to assist you in collision avoidance. For my own peace
      of mind be warned, AIS is only an assistance, it is not
      guaranteed, don't rely solely on AIS. The information transmitted
      by other vessels may be incorrect, it may be non-existent.<br>
      You will however be able to see most commercial vessels at a far
      greater distance and know their speed &amp; course. The use of
      virtual buoys will increase. AIS will give you greater peace of
      mind, particularly in fog. <br>
      <br>
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Transponders</span></small><br>
      An AIS transponder is a receiver coupled to an AIS transmitter,
      assuming your vessel is under 300 tons, you will be looking at a
      class B transponder. The details applicable to receivers also
      apply to transponders. A transponder makes your boat visible to
      commercial vessels on their AIS display. There are a couple of
      significant differences between Class A (used by commercial
      vessels) and Class B (under 300 tons). Apart from a massive price
      difference, the power output of Class B is much less (2 watts,
      class A is 12.5 watts) and the frequency of transmission is much
      less. In addition in the event of slot congestion, due to many
      vessels being in the same VHF range, Class B transmissions are
      suppressed.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: bold;"><small>Antenna





        Splitter</small><br>
    </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">As you will already have a
      VHF aerial, you can use the same aerial to receive AIS but you
      will need an antenna splitter such as <a
        href="http://www.easyais.com/">EasyAis</a>.<br>
      You must not connect a receiver directly to a transmitter aerial
      (you'll overload &amp; probably blow up the receiver). As
      splitters are more expensive than VHF aerials you may opt to use a
      separate marine VHF aerial. This will be quite adequate for use on
      a boat. If you are going to use a transponder you must ensure the
      splitter will work with a transponder (many won't) otherwise you
      will blow up the splitter.<br>
      Some receivers come with a built-in splitter such as the <a
href="http://www.icomuk.co.uk/categoryRender.asp?categoryID=3508&amp;cCID=15863">Icom





        MXA-5000</a>.<br>

    <span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: bold;"><small>Connecting
AIS





        to existing Instrumentation</small><br>
    </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Marine instruments normally
      talk to one another using NMEA, even those manufacturers using
      proprietary protocols provide NMEA converters so their instruments
      can both receive and send NMEA format data. If you are receiving
      AIS you will want other ships displayed on a chart, which will be
      either a chart plotter of a PC. If using a chart plotter, it will
      be connected to a GPS. If you are going to use a PC it will
      require a GPS input (so you know here you are on the chart). In
      both cases A GPS will be connected using NMEA input.<br>
      In NMEA terminology, a device connected to other NMEA devices is
      either a "talker" a "listener" or both. NMEA&nbsp; allows one
      talker to be connected to a maximum of 3 or 4 listeners, without
      using a buffer. In practice I have connected more than this
      without a problem. The NMEA voltage levels are also different to
      the voltage levels on a PC RS232 interface. Again in practice this
      does not seem to be a problem with modern PC's. If you put more
      than one talker on the same line at the same time some sentences
      will become garbled if both talkers talk at the same time (and
      there's a fair chance they will).<br>
      NMEA also has 2 different speeds 4,800 baud and 38,400 baud. AIS
      is always the higher speed, almost all other devices are the lower
      speed. For the above reasons the </span><span style="font-family:
      Arial;"></span><a style="font-family: Arial;"
      href="http://www.nasamarine.com/">NASA</a><span
      style="font-family: Arial;"> and </span><span style="font-family:
      Arial;"></span><a style="font-family: Arial;"
      href="http://smartradio.diytrade.com/">SR162</a><span
      style="font-family: Arial;"> have a NMEA input at 4,800 baud and
      combine this with the AIS sentences outputting both sentences
      sequentially at 38,00 baud. This allows only one input to be used
      on the PC or chart plotter.<br>
      As NMEA uses 8 bit ASCII characters you can see the NMEA sentences
      on your PC. by using Hyperterminal, set to 4,800 or 38,400 baud, 8
      bits, no parity ,no flow control. If you see rubbish characters
      the baud rate is incorrect.<br>
      <br>

      style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: bold;"> <small>Charts</small><span
        style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
      </span></span><span style="font-family: Arial;">These are
      difficult to obtain, unless you scan &amp; calibrate them
      yourself, or buy commercial charts (&amp; probably the software as
      well) that are compatible with the software you are using. <br>
    </span><br>
    <span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: bold;">More on
      Receivers</span><br style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: bold;">
    <small><span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: bold;">Dual
        channel<br>
      </span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><big>AIS transmissions
          are made on two channels (87B &amp; 88B) allocated from the
          normal marine VHF radio band. The frequencies of these
          channels are161.975 MHz and 162.025 MHz and are referred to as
          AIS Channel A and AIS Channel B. Ships transmitting AIS
          alternate their transmissions between these two channels. To
          receive all AIS transmissions a receiver must monitor both
          channels simultaneously, so the receiver must in effect be two
          receivers in one box. If two separate and different
          transmissions arrive at the receiver at the same time but on
          different channels both transmissions will be received and
          output by the receiver. This is referred to as a dual channel
          receiver. The</big></span></small><span style="font-family:

        channel<br>
      </span><span style="font-family: Arial;"></span></small><span
      style="font-family: Arial;">To reduce the cost of in effect having
      two receivers in one box, receivers can be designed to monitor the
      signal on both channels and when a signal is received on one or
      the other channel, switch the reception &amp; decoding circuit to
      this channel. If however at the same time a transmission is
      received on the other channel, this transmission will be lost.
      This is referred to as a Single Channel Receiver but you need to
      look at the manufacturer's specification closely, because the

      style="font-family: Arial;"></span><span style="font-family:
      Arial;">If you are using a single channel receiver, the number of
      "missed" messages will depend in part of the rate your receiver is
      receiving messages. My experience indicates that at around 100
      messages/minute (possibly 25 moving ships) you will miss around
      1/3rd of the messages with a single channel receiver compared with
      a dual channel receiver.<br>
      There are 2 categories of AIS messages you are probably most
      interested in namely the voyage related data (Speed,
      Course,Heading etc.) and the static information (Name of vessel,
      Size of vessel etc.). The voyage related messages are transmitted
      by each vessel every 2 seconds to once every 3 minutes, dependent
      on speed and change of course. The static messages are transmitted
      every 6 minutes. Once you have seen the vessel you are probably
      interested in its Name Size Type and it can be frustration waiting
      for up to 6 minutes to see these details. With a single channel
      receiver you can easily wait 15 minutes before the static
      information is displayed.<br>
      The choice is yours&nbsp; dual channel receivers are significantly
      more expensive.</span>&nbsp; <br>

      <span style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: bold;"></span></small><span
      style="font-family: Arial;">A communications receiver or scanner
      is a single channel receiver (even if it's scanning both
      channels), therefore I would not suggest buying a scanner just to
      receive AIS.<br>
      Communications receivers employ notch filters to limit the
      bandwidth. This is normally desirable if you wish to reduce
      interference at a frequency very close to the station you are
      actually trying to receive. To receive AIS transmissions you need
      a bandwidth of 25kHz, if you don't have this bandwidth you will
      receive very little if any decoded data. To ensure this is not
      reduced by filtering in the audio circuitry of the receiver, the
      audio output must be taken direct from the radio's discriminator.
      Some receivers provide this "Discriminator Tap" some don't, even
      on expensive communication receivers. Fortunately, on most radios
      and scanners it is possible (fairly simply) to fit a discriminator
      tap, if you can use a soldering iron. There is a very good website
      <a href="http://www.discriminator.nl">www.discriminator.nl</a>
      which will not only tell you if you need one, but also how to do
      it.<br>
      The received signal (GMSK/FM) will not be decoded, and will need
      to be connected to the Aux or Microphone in on the PC. You will
      also need a program to decode the Audio into NMEA sentences. By
      far away the most popular is </span><span style="font-family:

          style="font-weight: bold;">straight</span></small> cable is
      required to connect transmitted data (on DCE equipment) to
      received data (on DTE equipment). A receiver should be wired as
      DCE (Data Communication Equipment) and a PC will be wired as DTE
      (Data Terminal Equipment). A <small><span style="font-weight:
          bold;">crossover</span></small> cable is required to connect
      two of the same type of equipment together (eg 2 PC's). This
      crossover can be in an adapter called a Null Modem, which emulates
      the in/out on a modem (DCE). Unfortunately the distinction between
      DTE and DCE has become blurred &amp; not all manufacturers get it
      right anyway. If in doubt try one cable and if this doesn't work
      attach a null modem to either end of the cable. Or look at the
      manuals to ensure the TX on one device is wired to the Rx on the
      other by the connecting cable.<br>

    </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">As previously mentioned,
      you can normally "get away" with connecting several NMEA listeners
      to one NMEA talker. You are much less likely to succeed connecting
      two talkers together as they will both be trying to talk at the
      same time and you will inevitably loose some data. If you connect
      too many listeners to one talker, no damage should happen to the
      equipment, some of the connections will probable not work because
      the strength of the signal is too low. To get round this you have
      to use a NMEA buffer, which may have more than one input and a
      number of outputs. They are quite expensive because they normally
      electrically isolate all the inputs and outputs to reduce
      interference and earth loops.<br>

      </small><span style="font-weight: bold;">USB Connections<br>
      </span></span><span style="font-family: Arial;">First a little
      history. PC's used to have separate cards that plugged internally
      into the PC's "BUS". Each different device (for example keyboard,
      display, modem, printer, speakers, microphone, serial RS232) all
      had separate internal cards and a separate external socket in
      which to plug the device. PC's had loads of different types of
      sockets. This was inefficient and not suitable for much smaller
      PC's such as laptops, there just wasn't the space for all these
      cards. The fix was to remove the card from the PC and putting the
      hardware in the device. To enable completely different devices to
      plug into the one socket, the electrical signals passing between
      the device and the PC had to be much more complicated and would
      differ for each device. A USB connection has 4 wires, 2 carry
      power and 2 carry the signal. This means a separate power supply
      is no longer needed for the device. In addition, the signal is
      multiplexed so that up to 126 different devices can use the same
      physical wire. The actual signal is split into packets, in a
      similar manner to a network connection.<br>
      The device generates packets which have to be unscrambled with
      complementary software (the driver) running on the PC.<br>
      When you plug a USB device into your PC, a voltage is asserted on
      the signal wire telling the PC a device has been plugged in.
      Communication starts between the PC and the device. The device
      tells the PC which software to use to communicate with the
      device,&nbsp; if the PC cannot find it (it is specific to each
      device/manufacturer) and error will result. <br>
      You should be aware the power requirements for the device are also
      managed by the PC. If these power requirements are exceeded, the
      PC will fail to load the device driver, which can happen if too
      many power consuming devices are plugged into the same USB hub.<br>
      There are three different speeds of data transfer via a USB cable,
      these will be transparent to you as again they are managed by the
      software (the data transfer speed for a USB disc drive is very
      different to a USB keyboard).<br>
      <img style="width: 576px; height: 372px;" alt=""
        src="./usb_cable.gif"><br>
      It should be clear that although the physical USB lead is common,
      the actual data going down the lead is very different for
      different devices. This is why you can't get a "simple or dumb"
      serial to USB adapter. Note also when you purchase a "smart"
      adapter (and they all are), the drivers depend on the actual
      chip-set being used in the adapter.&nbsp; For example the&nbsp;<a
href="http://www.ftdichip.com/Products/EvaluationKits/USB-Serial.htm">FDTI





        adapter</a>&nbsp; Under £20 direct from FDTI uses the same FDTI
      chip-set as the <a
        href="http://www.comarsystems.com/ais_2_usb.html">Comar
        AIS-2-USB</a> receiver. <br>
      <br>
    </span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Network Connections</span><br>
      The usual connector for a network connection is <small
        style="font-weight: bold;">RJ45</small>, the type of cable this
      is connected to is called <small style="font-weight: bold;">CAT5E</small>.<br>
      <img style="width: 116px; height: 116px;" alt="" src="./rj45.jpg"><br>
      A very simplistic explanation follows.<br>
      Unlike serial connections, network connections are multiplexed,
      many connections being able to share the same cable. It is
      therefore quite OK to connect a number of devices together using a
      <small style="font-weight: bold;">hub</small> (or a <small
        style="font-weight: bold;">switch</small> - a clever hub). The
      data flowing round the network is sent in individually addressed
      packets which are captured by any device attached to the network,
      wishing to receive the data addressed to it. Some of this data can
      be sent to (or received from) the internet via a <small
        style="font-weight: bold;">router</small>. The method by which
      the data is transmitted over the cable is called <small><span
          style="font-weight: bold;">Ethernet.</span></small> The method
      by which the packets are addressed to individual devices is called
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">TCP </span><big>or <small><span
              style="font-weight: bold;">UDP</span><big>.<br>
              With a UDP network connection it is important to realise
              that although there is a physical connection it does not
              follow that data sent will be received. Like a receiver
              listening to a transmitter must be tuned to the same
              frequency, two devices connected together on a network
              must know one another's addresses. These addresses are
              called <small style="font-weight: bold;">IP addresses</small>
              and must be set in both devices. These can either be set
              manually (using a program) or automatically using a piece
              of software - maybe transparent to the user - called <small
                style="font-weight: bold;">DHCP</small>.<br>
            </big></small></big></small><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Connections into the PC</span><br>
      So there are four different types of connection into the PC -
      Serial, USB, Network and Audio. and your receiver could be plugged
      into any one of these. Your PC will be running an operating
      system&nbsp; eg. Windows, Linux, Mac. If you are using other than
      Windows, you will probably understand the differences to Windows,
      therefore I'll only consider how to set-up Windows. There are
      differences with versions of Windows, I'll talk about XP, the
      principle is the same for the other versions.<br>
      <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Network</span></small> you
      just plug in, there is nothing to set-up.<br>
      <small style="font-weight: bold;">Audio</small> should not be a

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Serial Ports</span><br>
      In the old days a PC would have a number of physical serial ports
      named Com1, Com2 etc. Each port has associated with it a driver.<br>
      The driver is a bit of software which transfers the data stream
      arriving at the serial port into the PC's memory. Once in memory
      this data is available for use by programs running on the PC.<br>
    </span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> To see which serial ports
      are available go to "Control Panel &gt; System &gt; Hardware &gt;
      Device Manager "<br>

        src="./devmgr_comport.gif"><br>
    </span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br>
      The stream of serial data arriving at the port is coming at a set
      speed (the baud rate) and this speed has to be synchronised with
      the speed the PC is expecting. This synchronisation can be done
      automatically, but normally isn't. If the speed set on the PC is
      not the same as the speed being received, it will appear that junk
      is being received. To set the speed </span><span

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">USB Ports</span><br>
      Most USB devices are "Plug-n-Play", This is made possible by the
      complex communications between a USB device and the application
      software outlined above. You plug in a scanner or camera &amp; it
      just works. This could be done with a USB receiver and a receiver
      specific display program. Unfortunately I'm not aware of any
      manufacturer who provides this software, and because of different
      users requirements, it probably will never been done. AIS is a too
      small market.<br>
      To get around this, if you wish to use a USB port on your PC, you
      have to convert the serial output from your PC to USB, and then
      convert it back to serial within your PC.<br>
      You do this by creating a virtual serial (COM) port on your PC.
      The supplier of your </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">serial





      to USB cable (or adapter), or your USB receiver, will have given
      you instructions on how to do this.</span><br>
    <span style="font-family: Arial;">After you have installed the
      driver and plugged the USB lead into your PC</span><span
      style="font-family: Arial;"> go to "Control Panel &gt; System &gt;
      Hardware &gt; Device Manager" to identify the number of the COM
      port which has been allocated. This will vary dependent on your
      PC's configuration.<br>
      <br>
      <img style="width: 640px; height: 451px;" alt=""
        src="./devmgr_usb.gif"><br>
      <br>
      You will see a virtual serial port has been created, in this case
      COM3. This COM port must be set to the correct baud rate in
      exactly the same way as the physical COM port described above.
      This will be 38400 baud for AIS NMEA. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Network Ports</span><br>
      A network connection is multiplexed which means many different
      devices can be connected (individually to one another) by sharing
      the same physical cable. The basic concept is data is sent up and
      down the physical link in packets, each packet having an address
      of the destination to which the packet is going. This address is
      called the IP address. Each device connected to the same network
      has a different IP address. In the case of a network AIS receiver
      (such as the Comar SLR200N) the receiver will have one IP address
      and your PC will have a different IP address. In this way your PC
      will only see packets addressed to itself, as will your receiver.
      Nowadays these IP addresses are normally allocated automatically,
      when a new device is plugged into your network (by a system called
      DHCP).<br>
      I may expand on this later which would help you when things don't
      work as expected.<br>
      <br>
      Your PC may have a number of programs running at the same time for
      example an internet connection and an AIS program. Your PC will be
      receiving data (in packets) via the same physical network
      connection so your PC needs to send some packets to your internet
      browser and some to your AIS program. To sort these out, the
      packets also contain a port number, which can be anywhere from 0
      to 65,535. Summarising, the IP address must be correct and the
      devices must be listening or sending data on mutually agreed port
      numbers. For many common applications such as Internet or file
      transfers, these port numbers follow a universal standard (so they
      are transparent to you), but for "minor" applications such as AIS
      there is no universal standard. You will have to set up the port
      number on both the AIS receiver and the AIS program to be the
      same. If they are not the same the two devices will not be talking
      to one another.<br>
      <br>
      There is one further complication with AIS networking, <small><span
          style="font-weight: bold;">TCP</span></small> and <small><span
          style="font-weight: bold;">UDP. </span><big>The packets in
          which the data is sent from one device to another may be
          "lost" of corrupted during transmission. TCP guarantees
          delivery of uncorrupted packets by means of a two way
          communication between the two devices, "lost" or corrupted
          packets being retransmitted until received correctly. UDP
          streams the data with no guarantee of delivery (like a radio
          transmitter). So why isn't TCP used all the time ?</big></small>
      The guarantee of delivery places a significant overhead on the
      speed of the data as well as the volume of bits (bandwidth). With
      AIS, the data your receiver has received is not guaranteed correct
      anyway, so why bother ensuring incorrect data is received
      incorrectly when it will soon be retransmitted by the vessel
      anyway.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Nmea Router<br>
      </span></span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Because of the
      multiplicity of different combinations of inputs and outputs, I
      have recently created a program to Route AIS data from one type of
      connection to another.<br>
