    Occasional dropouts on top graph are caused by ShipPlotter stalling
    because a server it is uploading to is stalling. This PC is using
    ShipPlotter to upload to 5 servers. The other PC running the second
    graph is not feeding data to any server.<br>
    You can <a href="./spxl.html">download the spreadsheet</a> that
    will produce these graphs automatically (if ShipPlotter is running).<br>

    <h3>How was it done ?</h3>
    Both receivers were fed simutaneously with the same signal from the
    same aerial.<br>
    A&nbsp;passive (non frequency dependant) 50 ohm splitter was used.<br>
    The splitter will degrade the signal in both recievers by a minimum
    of 3dB (halved).<br>
    Each receiver was connected to separate PC's running ShipPlotter.<br>
    The ole/com interface drove an identical vbs script on each PC,
    dynamically using Excel to draw the graphs..<br>
    ShipPlotter was purged immediately prior to starting the vbs script.<br>
    At the end of 60 mins the graph was saved, and a screen image
    captured.<br>
    I'll let you draw your own conclusions.<br>
    You can <a href="./spxl.html">download the spreadsheet</a> that
    will produce these graphs automatically (if ShipPlotter is running)
    without using vbs.<br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-weight:
      bold;">Notes</span><br>
    Propagation was exceptionally good due to the high pressure over
    Europe.<br>
    The range rings are set at 50 miles maximum.<br>
    Ships are "the total number of active ships (that would appear on
    the chart)".<br>
    Grey Ships was set at 10, and Omit Ships was set at 30<br>
    Msgs are as the counter at the bottom of the ShipPlotter screen.<br>
    The large blips on the graphs are probably caused by ShipPlotter
    buffering the messages while waiting on the sharing servers.<br>
