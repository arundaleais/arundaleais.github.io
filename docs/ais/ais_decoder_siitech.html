Client-Server ?</span></span></font><br>
<font style="font-family: Verdana;" size="-1"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">TCP</span> is a connection orientated
protocol. Handshaking between the sender and receiver ensures data sent
is actually received.<br>
With TCP all communication is 2-way - like a phone call, and like a
phone call one party has to initiate the conversation. The party
initiating the conversation is the client, because the called party has
to react to a request made by the client (eg answer the phone call) and
then respond back to the caller ("Hello").<br>
</font><font style="font-family: Verdana;" size="-1"><br>
A program which receives data from one source and forwards it to
another can act as both a client and a server. It will initiate a
connection to start receiving data (ie is a client) than send this data
to another program if asked (ie is a server).<br>
<br>
</font><font style="font-family: Verdana;" size="-1"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">UDP</span> is a connectionless protocol,
there is no handshaking, a packet sent is not guaranteed to be received.<br>
It is like a broadcast radio signal - you don't have to listen to it.
Is the transmitter or the receiver the server ?<br>
<br>
The answer appears to depend on your point of view. Microsoft clearly
regard the receiver as the client, however others<br>
regard the receiver as the server because the program receiving the
data reacts to data initiated by the sender.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Clear as mud ?</span></font><br>
<font style="font-family: Verdana;" size="-1">Microsoft regard a UDP
receiver as a client, SiiTech regard a UDP receiver as a server.</font><br>

This program creates<br>AIS NMEA messages based on the ships it can see in the ShipPlotter ship<br>list, using the OLE/COM interface.  It outputs position reports every 10<br>seconds, ship name/destination/etc. every 6 minutes, SAR aircraft every 10<br>seconds, and Groundstations every 10 seconds.<br><br>I then use AIS Server Lite to send that data to:<br>1.

TCP server on port 15151, for use on my internal network where I have<br>another PC running ShipTrax configured for TCP input beta testing.<br>3.
