<h2>Greg Kunkel's 5 Element Collinear<br>
</h2>
<br>
I am writing this email to describe the performance of a version of
your Mk1 &nbsp;5 element Collinear Antenna.<br>
It is constructed of RG58 coax with a 10 ft RG58 lead.<br>
It is connected with &nbsp;30ft &nbsp;RG6 coax to a ACR Nauticast AIS
Receiver which is then conneced by USB to my Windows XP computer.<br>
The Antenna is inserted into 10 ft of half inch PVC pipe and is hung
from the branches of a Norway spruce on its north side.<br>
The tree is on the south side of my house which is in the middle of
Long Island NY.<br>
My house is surrounded on the north and south with glacial moraines
averaging 150 ft in altitude.<br>
The bottom of the antenna is 75 ft above sea level.<br>
Frankly I expected very little reception to the south because of the
position of the antenna in the tree but I have seen no evidence that
the tree interferes with the signal.<br>
I have included a photo and some diagrams that demonstrate the
reception.<br>
I have not include some long range receptions of up to 130 miles, that
probably due to unusual atmospheric conditions.<br>
Thank you for your sharing of the plans.<br>
I have written a program in Delphi 5 to plot the AIS positions in real
time on my local charts and on Google Earth.<br>
