Version 68.<br>
Problem with NMEA GPS tags and synchronisation fixed.<br>
<b><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"></span>3.1.0.68</b><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span
style="font-weight:               bold;">    Help File<br>
</span></span>There is now a "Windows Style" help file (AisDecoder.chm), which
is downloaded on installation to your Program Files directory. When press the
Help button, you will be using this file. The new Help can be viewed
independently of AisDecoder by locating this file and clicking on it.The Web
Help File is out of date, but still on the Web Site for users who are using
older versions (access from download page). <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span
style="font-weight:               bold;"></span></span>Installer now checks to
ensure AisDecoder is not running prior to installing a later version<br>
<font size="-1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">3.1.0.67<br>
</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span
style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span></font><span
style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">There are some incompatible
changes with previous versions.<br>
The installed executable is now named AisDecoder - not AisDecoder_V3.</span><br>
<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;"></span><span
style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">The installation executable
is now AisDecoder_setup_3.1.0.67.exe (and will change with each
version).</span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span
style="font-weight:               bold;"></span></span><span
style="font-weight: bold;">    Downloading New Versions</span><br>
I have changed the complete download mechanism to<br>
1.    To try and make it more robust<br>
2.    To create a unique install executable file with each version<br>
3.    To as far as is possible allow multiple users on the same PC to have
their own settings files<br>
4.    Removed the Automatic Download of new versions.<br>
On start-up AisDecoder will (if there is an internet connection) check if there
is a later version.<br>
If so, it will enable the Update button on the Control/Stats window (the Update
text will cease to be "greyed out").<br>
On clicking the Update button AisDecoder will close and your browser will start
with the release notes. Having read the notes, you should click the link on the
Release Notes to go to the Download page.<br>
You cannot install AisDecoder unless you have Administrator privileges.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">    Sample and Settings Files</span><br>
For AisDecoder to start, it must have a valid initialisation file (.ini).<br>
The current user's files are kept in the "Current User" profile.<br>
There are a number of Sample or Example files to demonstrate some of the
possible options. These are explained in Help.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">    Other Changes</span><br>
Any user who is not an Administrator, will not be able to access the Options
Window so can only change settings on the Control/Stats Window, cannot save
these settings and will not be prompted to save changes on exit.<br>
If the Input Window was clicked, when no input sentences displayed, AisDecoder
stopped. This has been fixed.<br>
The Decoder will now output all decoded value fields as CSV, if CSV output is
selected and <span style="font-weight:             bold;">NO</span> field Tags
are selected.<br>
The sample file CsvAll.ini is preset to do this. <br>
The Ouput format is:-<br>
Received Timestamp (if it exists) , Vessel Name (blank if not received) , NMEA
Payload field , Delimited Decoded Payload Fields.<br>
The order in which the Delimited Decoded Payload Fields are output is the same
as in the Detail Window.<br>
KMZ output files are now supported for Google Earth. Just name the output file
*.KMZ<br>
Msg 21 (AtoN), if there is a name extension, the decoder now displays in the
Detail Window the number of fill bits (if any).<br>
If the Payload within a NMEA AIS message is too short to hold all the required
bits to decode the whole message, the number of bits short are displayed at the
bottom of the detail window. Any fields past the actual payload length will
have all bits set to 0 (zero).<br>
When you exit the program, if you have not saved your settings &amp; they have
changed, you will be prompted to save them. This will not happen for
non-administrators as they cannot save their settings anyway.<br>
If an AIS NMEA sentence had a valid CRC but insufficent words Ais Decoder could
crash, this is now reported as an error.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">    Profiles</span><br>
If you are the only user on your PC and you installed AisDecoder you do not
need to worry about Profiles.<br>
When the Ais Decoder Setup program downloaded user file files (including sample
files) are now placed into the "All Users" profile. <br>
The <span style="font-weight: bold;">first</span> time AisDecoder is run by any
user, <span style="font-weight:             bold;">all </span>files currently
existing in  "\All Users\Application Data\Arundale\AisDecoder" are copied to
"Current User\Application Data\Arundale\AisDecoder". This will include all the
above list of sample files as well as any additional files the Administrator
may have placed in the All Users profile.<br>
Although the Current User does have access to their own files, by default,
files in \Application Data\ are hidden, unless you are an Administrator.<br>
If the current user requires directory access to any of the AisDecoder folders
or files, create a shortcut in the user's "My Documents".<br>
After re-installing a new version of AisDecoder (or you have Adminstrator
priviledge), when you first run the new version, you will be prompted as to
whether you require any of the above sample files which differ from those in
your own profile, being overwriten.<br>
If you are not an administrator, they will be overwritten anyway.<br>
The first time a user runs a new version, default.ini is always overwritten in
the Current Users profile.<br>
The uninstaller will only remove the downloaded files (in All Users), the
"Current User" files will be automatically removed if you delete the "Current
User" profile.<br>
<font size="-1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">3.1.0.66<br>
</span>Code to output fill bits when added at the end of variable length
messages to fill message to next 8 bit boundary has been re-written, to
correctly decode when fill bits are tagged. This is used by message 20 (Shore
Station Data Link Management).<br>
Note a significant no of shore stations transmit incorrect message length.<br>
An Out of memory error fixed, caused by under certain circumstances a Microsoft
size limit being exceeded.<br>
An occasional Subscript error fixed.<br>
There were a number of problems in the decoding of the Communications State,
due to the variability of the bit positions. I believe the decoding is now
correct. Some shore stations appear to transmit incorrect data, for example
Next Slot Offset of 2250 - the maximum permitted slot is 2249 (these may be
test transmissions).<span style="font-weight:               bold;"><br>
3.1.0.65<br>
</span>The MMSI decoding has been split into MMSI and MID<br>
The MMSI description is the type of MMSI (for example Shore Station, SART
etc)<br>
The MID description is the Country.<br>
Where the MMSI does not contain a MID (for example SART) ,the MID is output as
0 (not blank).<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">3.1.0.64</span><br>
The special Tag &lt;IconHeading&gt; will output 511 if neither COG or HDG is
available.<br>
Internal changes to scheduled output, speed improvement of about 30%.<br>
</font><span style="font-weight: bold;"><font size="-1"><span
style="font-weight: bold;">3.1.0.63</span></font></span><br>
</p>
</div>
<font size="-1">The special Tag &lt;IconHeading&gt; will always be in whole
degrees even if COG is used. This is for compatibility between Google Maps and
Google Earth.<br>
If FTP fails, error messages now written to /logs/error.log to enable error to
be recovered when running in nowindow mode.<br>
</font></div>
</div>

<div>
<font size="-1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">3.1.0.62</span><br>
The current version number on the Control/Stats window can be "clicked" to
bring up a list of all version changes.  <br>
Suppress error messages on FTP, if command option noWindow is set. If nowindow
is set FTP errors will no longer trigger an error window.<br>
</font><font size="-1">I will be changing my Tags from &lt;tag&gt; to [Tag], ie
() to [] shortly.<br>
This is to enable a kml template to be compatible with an XML parser, before
the Tag is substituted. This will necessitate you changing all your tags (not
Google Tags) in your kml template files.<br>
</font><font size="-1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">3.1.0.61</span><br>
Added a special Tag &lt;IconHeading&gt; which may be used to align Vessel Icon
on a GIS display with North relative to COG if HDG is not available. This is
only available on Tagged output when GIS<br>
</font><font size="-1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">3.1.0.60</span><br>
If a range has been set for a Tag and no messages has been received containing
the Tag the MMSI will now fail the range check and no output will occur for
this MMSI.<br>
This check is only done if Tags are output on MMSI Change, otherwise if all
Tagged messages are being output separately (ie not on a change of MMSI) and
Tags are set on different AIS message types, no output would occur, as there
would always be blank Tags on every message.<br>
</font><font size="-1"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></font><font
size="-1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">3.1.0.59</span><br>
Another minor change to try and ensure the correct column is selected when
adding a new Tag<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></font><font size="-1"><span
style="font-weight: bold;">3.1.0.58</span><br>
Yet another try at making the Automatic Version Updater work properly, next
time.<br>
When Field Tag was selected on Detail Window, intermittently incorrect column
was selected to output. The effect was instead of Tag value being output, Tag
description was output.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></font><font size="-1"><span
style="font-weight: bold;">3.1.0.57</span><br>
Input Field Window, previous fix to retain focus resulted in changed tag name
being "lost".<br>
</font><font size="-1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">3.1.0.56</span><br>
If serial port failed to open, Decoder kept trying even after stop pressed. Max
&amp; Min Range tag not always output<br>
</font><font size="-1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">3.1.0.55</span><br>
Serial Input from Com Port added<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></font><font size="-1"><span
style="font-weight: bold;">3.1.0.54</span><br>
Improvements to Accept Input Filter when ticking deep sub items.<br>
Note you do not have to tick sub items - they are assumed to be ticked.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></font><font size="-1"><span
style="font-weight: bold;">3.1.0.53</span><br>
Problems with FTP upload output file location, hopefully fixed<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></font><font size="-1"><span
style="font-weight: bold;">3.1.0.52</span><br>
Added FTP client to upload Output file to Web Server<br>
The file is FTP'd to the server whenever the Output file is closed, this would
normally be after the scheduler has created the file.<br>
The Server logon password is held encrypted in the .ini file using some of the
PC's parameters as a key. This means, if you save the .ini file on one PC then
transfer it to another, you will have to re-enter your Server logon password.
It does however mean you can send the .ini file to another user without
revealing your password.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></font><font size="-1"><span
style="font-weight: bold;">3.1.0.51</span><br>
When outputting all Tag messages (not on MMSI change) each part of multipart
AIS messages was output. This was incorrect and has been fixed.<br>
GPS NMEA sentences were not given a unique default Tag, the default Tag is now
unique<br>
Tag Template File re-read on exiting Options Window, to ensure if min or max
range is changed, and used as a Tag, they are replaced in the Template<br>
</font><font size="-1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">3.1.0.50</span><br>
Option added to output Tags/CSV after each message rather than on change of
MMSI.<br>
This is to allow, when reading a log file, to output the history of one
vessel.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></font><font size="-1"><span
style="font-weight: bold;">3.1.0.49</span><br>
Alterations to directory options when selecting new files.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></font><font size="-1"><span
style="font-weight: bold;">3.1.0.48</span><br>
Downloaded initialisation files were retaining my directory paths.<br>
Slight cleanup of display of $GPxxx NMEA sentence tags.<br>
Additional sample template file GoogleMaps.xml now supplied with the
download.<br>
This template will output a XML file which is compatible with the widely used
sample webpage Curt Deegan's vbship4.zip which can be downloaded from the files
section (vbscripts) of the ShipPlotter forum.<br>
</font><font size="-1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">3.1.0.47</span><br>
Limited processing of $GPZDA and $GPGGA messages added to allow GPS time
stamping.<br>
The default tags are the type of NMEA sentence (eg $GPZDA).<br>
Note if trying to output tag values (including CSV), the Tag Value is only
output when the<br>
MMSI changes, as GPS sentences will not have a MMSI, you will not get any
output until an AIS sentence with an MMSI is output. As with all tagged output,
the decoder will only output the latest Tag value, if more than one message
with the same Tag has been received, since the previous Tag was output.<br>
If you require to see all messages, you should use NMEA output.<br>
The above required adding additional input filter options in the sample
initialisation files - default.ini,GoogleEarth.ini and udptagsrange.ini.<br>
These files are overwritten each time you download a new version.<br>
If you are using your own "save as" initialisation files, you will not see
these additional Input Filter Options.    <br>
If the Output File Name ends in .htm*, the content is now written to the output
file WITHOUT a line terminator (crlf). This is to try and avoid browsers
replacing the &lt;crlf&gt; with a space.<br>
(This may cause other problems, so may have to be changed again).<br>
</font><font size="-1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">3.1.0.46</span><br>
You can insert the minimum or maximum Range value into a Tagged Output File by
appending _min or _max to the name on the tag. Eg &lt;lat_min&gt; wil insert
the minimum value of the lat tag into the output file.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></font><font size="-1"><span
style="font-weight: bold;">3.1.0.45</span><br>
Problem changing Output file with tag template file fixed<br>
Some minor changes to output display<br>
Download moved to ./aisdecoder_setup_v3.exe<br>
</font><font size="-1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">3.1.0.44</span><br>
Bug NMEA UDP with Range filtering and not Scheduled not outputting fixed<br>
</font><font size="-1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">3.1.0.43</span><br>
Download error bug fixed<br>
Options window would not close bug fixed<br>
Stats updating fixed<br>
</font><font size="-1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">3.1.0.42</span><br>
Help file button now links to V3 User Guide - which is progressively being
updated.<br>
GIS button added to Control/Stats window to automatically display KML file on
Google Earth<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></font><font size="-1"><span
style="font-weight: bold;">3.1.0.41</span><br>
Options Display format changed slightly again<br>
Output routines altered to try and ensure output is split correctly (as the
expense of some speed)<br>
More comprehensive checking of options settings with improved user messages<br>
(there is scope for improving these messages).<br>
</font><font size="-1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">3.1.0.40</span><br>
Options Display format changed slightly<br>
Csv Delimiter selection coded<br>
Duplicated message output bug fixed<br>
</font><font size="-1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">3.1.0.39</span><br>
Another significant code cleanup on output options.<br>
Option Layout changed to further clarify and allow display of output without
actually outputting data.<br>
Both File and UDP output now displayed in separate windows.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></font><font size="-1"><span
style="font-weight: bold;">3.1.0.38</span><br>
Download timeout increased for 60 to 90 seconds.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></font><font size="-1"><span
style="font-weight: bold;">3.1.0.37</span><br>
Fixed bug that could result in a valid tag value not being output<br>
If the CSV delimiter if found in the value of a tag, the value is output as a
quoted string for example if the delimiter is a comma:---<br>
244387000,20/10/2010 14:15:19,PRIDE OF BRUGES,"Passenger-carrying DG,HS,MP,IMO
haz or pollutant X"<br>
</font><font size="-1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">3.1.0.36</span><br>
Fixed bug that could result in nmea and tagged output intermingled<br>
Main and Options Display layout and terminology changed<br>
Raw called NMEA and NMEA called Time Stamped<br>
</font><font size="-1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">3.1.0.35</span><br>
Output Options and display re-structured to be clearer<br>
You can now set the same Options independently for both File or UDP output<br>
Some combination of Options can result in no output if they are mutually
exclusive<br>
Before Output all sentences are Input Filtered.<br>
Sentences can then be Scheduled and/or Range Filtered.<br>
When Output they can be NMEA, CSV or Tagged.<br>
The Scheduler holds the latest AIS sentence, by message type, for the Time to
Live.<br>
After the Scheduled Time has elapsed, all the buffered sentences are released
in MMSI order.<br>
A Tag is a name + value allocated to an AIS Message field. The same Tag (eg
MMSI or Latitude) can be allocated to different AIS message types. This is
necessary if the same data for example a vessel's position, can be extracted
from more than one AIS message type. <br>
The Range Filter extracts the value of any Field (defined in the Output Fields
and Tags on the Options Display), keeping the latest value received.<br>
A From-To Range may be set for the Tag (defined in the Output Tags and Range on
the Options Display).<br>
AIS messages are checked if they are within Range for Output in groups by
MMSI.<br>
Any Group of messages (having the same MMSI), not containing an AIS message
which has a Tag Range set, will be output. This is because it is indeterminate
at the time whether the MMSI is or not within the range. <br>
Likewise a message without a Tag, not previously rejected by the Input Filter,
will be output.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">NMEA</span>    If "Raw" is ticked, the NMEA
sentence will have the Time Stamp removed.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">CSV</span>      If a Tag has no value, or has
not been seen, a null will be output at the Tag's position. <br>
           If no Tags have been specified, nothing will be output.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Tagged</span>    If "GIS" is ticked, only
messages containing both a Latitude and Longitude will be output, as outputing
data to Geographic Information Systems, without a position is meaningless.   
 <br>
I have set three sample initialisation (.ini) files.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">default.ini</span> is a basic file to just
ouput received data<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">UdpTagsRange.ini</span> has UDP output, Common
Vessel data, and Lat/lon Range pre-set. You will need to reset the lat/lon to
get any output.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">GoogleEarth.ini</span>    Creates a
GoogleEarth KML file.<br>
Once a minute Data.kml should be created in the Output directory. Provided you
have Google Earth installed on your PC, if you clickon the data.kml file, you
should see all received vessels on GoogleEarth. The template file (in the
Templates directory) is about a simple as it can be to still work. <br>
I have tested this using the data from AisHub, receiving around 6000 messages a
minute, Outputting around 6000 vessels to a 1Mb file in around 10 seconds, on
my XP pc. You can of course alter any of these files if you wish, but bear in
mind if you do not rename them, I'll overwrite them when you upload a later
version of my decoder.<br>
I still need to do some work on the actual displays, this is rather time
consuming and I wish to ensure the basic engine is working as expect, without
bugs, and with all the main options in place.<br>
As there are now a large number of output options, it's impossible for myself
to test all the options so if you find any bugs, I would appreciate you letting
me know.<br>
</font><font size="-1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">3.1.0.34</span><br>
Additional UDP output option CSV added<br>
Renamed the UDP Output Options, Raw Scheduled to Raw, Scheduled to Tagged.
These will not be renamed unless you re-create any saved .ini files <br>
The new default.ini and udptagsrange.ini that are downloaded to your PC with
this version are already fixed.<br>
On installation, I have placed in the Files directory "Output Options
Schematic.pdf" which should help you to understand how the options should
work.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></font><font size="-1"><span
style="font-weight: bold;">3.1.0.33</span><br>
The Tag Template File being used was not retained between restarts if a Tagged
file was selected for output.<br>
There is a minor change to the code but it also requires the file name to be
loaded first in the initialisation process.<br>
</font><font size="-1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">3.1.0.32</span><br>
Tag range filter changed from OR to AND, all range conditions (if set) must be
met otherwise no output will happen for the current MMSI. <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></font><font size="-1"><span
style="font-weight: bold;">3.1.0.31</span><br>
Well there were some bugs, in particular with selecting different output
combinations<br>
Hopefully these are mainly fixed - if you find any more where it does not seem
to be doing what your expecting, please let me know.<br>
There was also a mistake in the example.aspx<br>
I have added an example.html and a data.kml file in the templates directory,
and a UdpTagsRange.ini file in the Settings directory.<br>
If you select the UdpTagsRange.ini file (Options &gt; Open) it can create a
file, provided your Ships are within the pre-set Latitude range, which will
contain the Tags required for the HTML or KML file. The HTML file can be opened
with any browser and the KML file<br>
can be opened with Google Earth (you can also upload it to Google Maps
server).<br>
</font><font size="-1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">3.1.0.30</span><br>
Option Added If you Right Click on Detail display the content will be placed on
the Clip Board as CSV. You may Paste the contents into Notepad and open it with
Excel.<br>
I would like to try and concentrate for a while on fixing any bugs (which there
will be) and getting it stable before adding any additional features, unless
anyone has any relatively simple issues. There are so many different options
now that I cannot check all of them, so if anything does not work as you or I
expect, I need to sort these out as well.<br>
In addition, I would like to make a start on documentation, as this would help
understanding what it will and won't do at the moment.<br>
</font><font size="-1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">3.1.0.29</span><br>
Program may not start if default initialisation file not set.<br>
The startup initialisation file is now reset to default after new version
downloaded.<br>
This is caused by changes I'm still making to the initialisation file format,
which is not yet stable. I now make an attempt to recover and if you save the
file, save it in the "new" format. You may however loose some of the settings,
if I've madean incompatible change.<br>
Scroll added to Splash Display (version changes on startup)<br>
</font><font size="-1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">3.1.0.28</span><br>
Note:--- Any existing .ini files will probably fail.<br>
Option to output "Raw" Log file (without time stamp) added<br>
Option to output filtered UDP "Raw" sentences added<br>
Option to Output UDP Scheduled "Raw" - allowing you to only output those
sentences that pass the Tag output range filtering. For example Vessels within
a defined geographic area. You do not have to create a Tagged file to do this,
but you must create the tags<br>
because the range is set by Tag and not individual AIS message no fields.<br>
Option to merge the Tags with a "Tagged" template file enabling you to create,
for example, a HTML, XML, KML, CSV or aspx etc file. The Template file should
be in the Ais Decoder/Templates directory. The output file will have the same
name but will be placed in the Ais Decoder/Output directory. There should be a
simple example file in the directory. I have also included a more complicated
setup file.<br>
Major rewrite of Open, Save and SaveAs routine error trapping and informing
users of problems opening or saving initialisation and log files.<br>
I have tried to cover all angles including:---<br>
    Files or directories not existing.<br>
    Files being deleted<br>
    Incorrectly formatted files<br>
    ReadOnly files<br>
Next up - Fixing bugs permitting !<br>
    Save Option on Detail Display<br>
</font><font size="-1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">3.1.0.27</span><br>
UDP output of Tagged output enabled.<br>
You must set the IP address and port no on the Options Display while the
decoder is STOPed.<br>
Clicking the Nmea List Display will Display the Detail of the Nmea Sentence, in
the same manner as clicking the Ais List Display.<br>
Hour Glass mousepointer fixed again (mistake last time)<br>
More changes to display layouts<br>
Clicking on a Tag in Options &gt; Output Tags will delete all fields in Options
&gt; Output Fields containing the same Tag.<br>
Next up (apart from fixing any bugs you find) is Outputting a file to your
template with embedded values in the tags.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></font><font size="-1"><span
style="font-weight: bold;">3.1.0.26</span><br>
Inform Users of changes since last version - Like this !<br>
Main Display Screen Layout changed<br>
Please note:-<br>
I will be making some changes to the Initialisation (.ini) files which will be
incompatible with any existing files, so please don't create loads of
individual settings as they may not work until I've stabalised the format.<br>
When you download a new version, the existing default.ini file will be
overwritten.<br>
Options I'm about to implement are "Greyed Out".<br>
I'm Experimentally outputting the Scheduled Output on UDP data on port 39421,
to allow me to test it over the internet.<br>
If you wish to re-read this message (you'll only see it once), the file should
be in the directory (\Files\) as displayed on the bottom of the main
display.<br>
</font><font size="-1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">3.1.0.25</span><br>
